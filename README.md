# AIrchive
A repository for the ARchive project, which aims to house and preserve all AI models in a digital environment one day.

##Introduction
The goal of the AIrchive project is to create a digital environment which can be used to house AI models for a variety of reasons.

From the responsibility to preserving them to the potential that they represent sentient life or may do one day.
